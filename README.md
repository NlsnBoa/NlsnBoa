### Hello and Welcome! 
 My name is Nelson Herrera and I am a student at the University of Central Florida, where I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I have always been drawn to problem solving and enjoy the challenge of puzzles, which led me to this field. I have been working hard to develop my skills in Java, C, Javascript, CSS, and Python but I know I have much more to learn. Currently, I am leanring how to use API's and projects to level up my experience. I am excited to share my creations with you!
