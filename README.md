### Hello and Welcome!
 My name is Nelson Herrera and I am a student at the University of Central Florida, where I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I have always been drawn to problem solving and enjoy the challenge of puzzles, which led me to this field. I have been working hard to develop my skills in C, Javascript, CSS, and Java, but I know I have much more to learn. I am excited to share my creations with you!
